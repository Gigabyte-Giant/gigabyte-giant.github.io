                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Howdy, my name is Brynden, better known by my alias "Gigabyte Giant". I'm a teenager with a passion for pretty much anything related to technology, including (but not limited to) software and web development.</p>
                    <p>My journey into the land of technology started in the middle/late part of 2007, which is when I started creating "webpages" using Microsoft Word. After a few months of creating webpages using Microsoft Word, I was introduced to HTML and CSS, which I spent the next few months working with.</p>
                    <p>Some time after I started using HTML and CSS, my Dad introduced me to the fascinating world of Visual Studio, and with that, Visual Basic and C#. I don't remember doing much with Visual Basic, but I do remember spending a fair bit of time writing applications using Microsoft's <a href="http://smallbasic.com/">"Small Basic" programming language</a>.</p>
                    <p>At some point in time, I shifted my focus to C#.NET, with which I created a couple different applications, one of which was a web browser (which was heavily reliant on Microsoft's "WebView" control). The other application of interest, which was built in part with my Dad, was a note-taking application called "NoteTaker".</p>
                    <p>"NoteTaker" had two versions, the regular version, which contained not much more than a text editor and some buttons. The second version (which was called "NoteTaker Admin" for some reason that is unknown to me today) contained a text editor and buttons, along with a built-in web browser (again, nothing more than Microsoft's "WebView" control).</p>
                    <p>At some point during the lifetime of the "NoteTaker" project, my Dad introduced me to the concept of version control, through means of <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> and <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/devhub">KilnHg</a> (now called "FogBugz Dev Hub"). Without my "NoteTaker" project, I highly doubt I'd be as interested in programming as I am today.</p>
                    <p>Some time after I'd stopped working on the "NoteTaker" project, I purchased a copy of the voxel-based game "Minecraft". As many did, I spent countless hours playing Minecraft. Eventually however, I got bored, because there was nothing new for me to learn about the game. At that point, I decided to try my hand at writing server plugins and client mods. As some will know, this involves Java. I spent a year or so creating mods for Minecraft, but eventually ran out of ideas.</p>
                    <p>At some point in time (late-2012 or early-2013 I think), Khan Academy, which I'd used as part of my homeschooling, introduced a computer science curriculum. Since I was still fairly interested in programming, and because I was already a member of Khan Academy, I decided to try it out. During the early days of Khan Academy's computer science curriculum, they had a single course which taught the basics of JavaScript, with the addition of the Processing.js graphics library.</p>
                    <p>I spent a lot of time with Khan Academy's CS curriculum, and created a lot of programs that, at that point in time, seemed cool. My adventure with the Khan Academy CS curriculum, and Khan Academy as a whole, picked up quite a bit of steam in December of 2014, when I was approached about becoming a discussion moderator (referred to as a "Khan Academy Guardian"). I eventually found out that wasn't going to pan out, because of my age.</p>
                    <p>To make a <em>[very]</em> long story fairly short, I spent most of my time in 2015, contributing to Khan Academy's CS curriculum, by answering questions asked by other students. I also spent a lot of time contributing to one of Khan Academy's open-source projects, which was created for use with Khan Academy's CS curriculum. The project is called the "live-editor", and as the name might suggest, it's a browser-based code editor that contains a semi-live view of your code's output.</p>
                    <p>In 2015, while I was contributing to Khan Academy's live-editor project, I formed a team, and started a new project, designed to help Khan Academy employees judge the CS contests that they held. We, the team behind the project, spent a long time working together to build the web-based application. Our work paid off, as the Khan Academy team used the tool, and our GitHub repository was even starred by John Resig.</p>
                    <p>I spent a long time working on both the live-editor, and the contest judging application. My work was apparently recognized, as I was actually approached about becoming a contractor for Khan Academy, to work on their CS challenge framework, and/or their live-editor project. In the late part of 2015, after a lot of work, and a lot more waiting, I was informed that, because of my age, I would not be able to join Khan Academy's team as a contractor. As one could imagine, I was extremely disappointed.</p>
                    <p>Even though I didn't get a job after all my work, I learned a ton. I gained a lot of real-world experience, and I got to work closely with some really cool people, including those whose work history is extremely impressive (i.e. people that worked at Google).</p>
                    <p>In late-December of 2015, myself and the rest of the team behind the previously mentioned contest judging application, decided to abandon the project. I also made the decision that I was going to step away from Khan Academy, and work towards a job elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>If you move programming aside, you'll find that I'm also interested in endurance racing. My interest in the sport started in September of 2015, when I got the opportunity to head to Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas for the Lone Star Le Mans weekend, which turned out to be an absolutely amazing experience.</p>
                    <p>I also enjoy spending time with my dog, who I decided to name "Hex" (<strong>as in hexadecimal</strong>; yes, I'm a geek). Hex is a mix between a <a href="http://www.dogbreedplus.com/dog_breeds/border_collie_lab_mix.php">Labrador and a Border Collie</a>. As is the case with most programmers, he spends a good bit of his time chasing bugs. He also enjoys playing ball, running around, and sleeping.</p>
